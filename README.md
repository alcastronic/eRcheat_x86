# eRcheat_x86


Cheat sheets for x86 (IA-32) eRverse engineering I have used for the university course "Systemnahe Programmierung" at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t [1][2].  
Most of the content is from the lecture material (not public), thanks to Dr. Werner Massonne for the permission to publish the content.  
The course, in German, can also be attended without the need to be enrolled to the university. Usually in the summer semester. Check out the blog [3] for updates.  

Special thanks to @0x6D6172636F who created x86re.com [4] where I took some bits from. The PDF IA32-I.pdf is from Princeton University [5]

The material is published as is, and I won't continue to work on it. You are welcome to open issues or make pull requests.
